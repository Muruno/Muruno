# CSS-Only Image Carousel (no, really)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/osef/pen/BaRqeLP](https://codepen.io/osef/pen/BaRqeLP).

An image slider made using only HTML and (S)CSS.
Includes navigation dots and arrows.
You can change the amount of images to display by modifying one style sheet global variable !

This can be really portable for websites powered by Node, Angular, Svelte, React etc.
